# react-portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project was to use react to build a portfolio web application to showcase my previous projects and ability that I have gain this far in this journey as a full stack development bootcamp student. The process of building this application allowed me to use various technologies  such as react and json to create a responsive application to boost my portfolio.
